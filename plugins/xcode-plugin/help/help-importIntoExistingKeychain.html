  <p>
  If it is checked, the developer profile will be imported into the existing keychain.</ br>
  If not checked, create a new key chain with the file name "jenkins-" + "job name" newly, and import the developer profile into this. (In this case, a random character string is automatically generated and used for the password)</ br>
  When importing developer profiles into a temporary key chain, please make sure that there are no duplicate certificates or private keys in the developer profile you import into the default keychain etc.</ br>
  If duplicate certificates or secret keys are included in both, Xcode gets confused and can not process the codesign correctly.
